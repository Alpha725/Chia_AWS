Intention is to create a plotter -> farmer cluster
Idea would be that you can plot quickly over multiple instances. 
In a way this means that you are almost directly investing to have alot farmable plots
This is more doable than before with the invention of madmax plotter. 

May work on in the future, parked atm due to lack of time and interest
